# xt_sslpin 
_netfilter/xtables module: match SSL/TLS certificate finger prints_


## SYNOPSIS

    iptables -I <chain> .. -m sslpin [!] --fpl <finger print list id> [--debug] ..


## DESCRIPTION

For an introduction to SSL/TLS certificate pinning, see: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Pinning_Cheat_Sheet

xt_sslpin lets you do certificate validation/pinning at the netfilter level.

xt_sslpin will only validate the public key (with minimal performance impact), and applications are expected to do further certificate chain validation and signature checks (i.e. normal SSL/TLS processing).


## EXAMPLE

    iptables -I INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED -p tcp --sport 443 \
        -m sslpin --debug --fpl 1 \
        -j DROP

## INSTALLATION

Prerequisites

* linux kernel > 3.7, check ```$ uname -r```
* gcc
* git
* iptables-dev

then:

    git clone https://github.com/Enteee/xt_sslpin.git
    cd xt_sslpin
    sudo apt-get install iptables-dev # xtables.h

Build and install:

    make
    sudo make install

Verify install:

    iptables -m sslpin -h

Usage: _See Example and Options sections._


##### Uninstalling

Clean source/build directory:

    make clean

Uninstall:

    sudo make uninstall


## OPTIONS

Options preceded by an exclamation point negate the comparison: the rule will match if the presented SSL/TLS certificate does NOT have the specified public key.


### `[!] --pubkey <alg>:<pubkey-hex>`

If a "Certificate" message is seen, match if the certificate has the specified public key.

`<alg>` denotes the expected Public Key Algorithm, and can be one of the following: *rsa, dsa, ec*.

`<pubkey-hex>` is the subjectPublicKey as hex bytes, e.g.: `0011223344`.

(_The `--debug` option can be used to get the public key for a site/IP._)



### `--debug`

Verbose logging.

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

Per connection, the incoming handshake data is parsed once across all -m sslpin iptables rules;
upon receiving the SSL/TLS handshake ChangeCipherSpec message, the parsed certificate is checked by all rules.

After this, the connection is marked as "finished", and xt_sslpin will not do any further checking.
(Re-handshaking will not be checked in order to incur minimal overhead, and as the server has already proved
its identity).

Up until the ChangeCipherSpec message is received, xt_sslpin will drop out-of-order TCP segments to
parse the data linearly without buffering. Conntrack takes care of IP fragment reassembly up-front, but packets
can still have non-linear memory layout; see skb_is_nonlinear().

If SYN is received on a time-wait state conn/flow, conntrack will destroy the old cf_conn
and create a new cf_conn. Thus, our per-conn state transitions are simply new->open->destroyed (no reopen).


## TODO

* ECParameters/namedCurve pinning in addition to current alg+pubkey pinning
* Optional buffering for reordered TCP segments during handshake (no RTT penalty / overhead)
* TCP Fast Open (TFO) support
* Restrict TCP Options / TCP stack passthrough
* IPv6 support
